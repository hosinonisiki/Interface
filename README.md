Hi there whoever is reading. This is my first repository.

This project is intended to provide comprehensive feedback-control and easy-turnkey experience for the other members in my physical research group.

I have been using github for years, but I still often feel unfamiliar with many utilities and conventions, such as branches, liscence and so on. So I decided to put this personal project which I'm currently working with onto github. Partly it is for version management, but more importantly I want to communicate with the code community.
I'm an undergraduate and does not major in computer science. I learned all the code stuff myself, without going through any formal training, so my code may look weird sometimes. If you find any mistakes or anything that I could improve, feel free to tell me. Also please inform me if I'm wrongly using the utilities of github or did not follow some convention. At last, I'm happy to share my experience in FPGA learning.
